 
# EduMobile App

A React Native mobile application with clean navigation flow and modern UI components.

## Navigation Setup

This project uses React Navigation v7 with the following structure:

- **Initial Route**: `LoginScreen`
- **Navigation Flow**: 
  - `LoginScreen` → `ForgotPasswordScreen` (via "Forgot Password?" button)
  - `ForgotPasswordScreen` → `LoginScreen` (via back button)
  - `LoginScreen` → `HomeScreen` (after successful sign in)
  - `LoginScreen` → `SignUpScreen` (for new user registration)

## Features

- ✅ React Navigation v7 with native stack navigator
- ✅ SafeAreaProvider for proper device safe areas
- ✅ React Native Paper for consistent UI components
- ✅ TypeScript support with proper navigation types
- ✅ Clean, production-ready code structure
- ✅ Responsive design with proper scaling
- ✅ No console warnings or unnecessary imports

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- React Native CLI
- iOS Simulator (for iOS development)
- Android Studio (for Android development)

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. For iOS, install pods:
```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

3. Start Metro bundler:
```bash
npm start
```

4. Run on device/simulator:

**iOS:**
```bash
npm run ios
```

**Android:**
```bash
npm run android
```

## Navigation Implementation Details

### App.tsx
- Wrapped with `SafeAreaProvider` and `NavigationContainer`
- Uses `createNativeStackNavigator` for smooth native transitions
- Starts with `LoginScreen` as the initial route
- All screens have `headerShown: false` for custom headers

### LoginScreen
- Main authentication screen
- "Forgot Password?" button navigates to `ForgotPasswordScreen`
- Uses React Native Paper components for consistent styling
- Responsive design with proper scaling

### ForgotPasswordScreen
- Password recovery screen with email input
- Back button (arrow-left icon) returns to `LoginScreen`
- "Send OTP" button for password reset functionality
- Consistent theme with LoginScreen

## Dependencies

- `@react-navigation/native`: Core navigation library
- `@react-navigation/native-stack`: Native stack navigator
- `react-native-screens`: Native screen components
- `react-native-safe-area-context`: Safe area handling
- `react-native-paper`: Material Design components
- `react-native-gesture-handler`: Gesture handling

## Code Quality

- ✅ Functional components with hooks
- ✅ Proper TypeScript typing
- ✅ Separated styles from component logic
- ✅ Clean imports and exports
- ✅ Consistent naming conventions
- ✅ Proper error handling structure

## Future Enhancements

- Add authentication state management
- Implement actual API calls for login/forgot password
- Add form validation and error handling
- Implement biometric authentication
- Add dark mode support
- Add unit tests for navigation flows

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter navigation issues:

1. Ensure all navigation dependencies are properly installed
2. Check that `react-native-screens` is linked correctly
3. Verify iOS pods are installed (`cd ios && pod install`)
4. Clear Metro cache (`npm start -- --reset-cache`)
5. Rebuild the app after dependency changes

## Contributing

1. Follow the existing code structure
2. Use TypeScript for all new files
3. Maintain consistent styling with React Native Paper
4. Add proper navigation types for new screens
5. Test navigation flows on both platforms
